This is a web application for managing cakes.
The application manages bakers and the cakes they create. Each cake is made by one baker.

The /index page displays all cakes.
New cakes can be added via the /add_cake page or by clicking the Add button on the index page, rather than using the Django admin interface.

The main technologies used are Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
